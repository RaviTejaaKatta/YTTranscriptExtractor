# Welcome to the Best Chatbot Data Collection Ever ðŸŽ‰

So, you stumbled upon this repository, huh? Congratulations! You've just discovered the treasure trove of data for the most revolutionary chatbot project ever. Buckle up, because you're about to embark on a journey filled with excitement, intrigue, and... well, data.

## About

This repository houses the data collected for our groundbreaking chatbot project. We didn't just grab any old data; we meticulously extracted subtitles from YouTube videos using the almighty YouTube Transcript API. Because why settle for mediocrity when you can have YouTube transcripts?

## What's Inside?

- `data/`: Behold, the Holy Grail of chatbot data â€“ a directory containing our precious subtitle files. Don't touch them; they're fragile.
- `data_collection.ipynb`: A riveting tale in the form of a Jupyter Notebook, chronicling our epic data collection journey. Spoiler alert: there were ups, downs, and lots of code.
- `requirements.txt`: A boring list of Python libraries we begrudgingly depend on. Because what's a project without dependencies, right?

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. Or don't. We won't force you, but we'll silently judge you if you don't.
2. Install the required Python libraries. You know the drill â€“ just run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. It's not rocket science.
3. Explore the `data/` directory. Behold the wonders of our meticulously curated subtitle files. Use them wisely, for they hold the secrets to... well, subtitles.
